Installing
----------

    !git clone https://github.com/MilaNLProc/prompting_hate_speech
    !cd prompting_hate_speech
    pip install -e .

**Important**: If you want to use CUDA you need to install the correct version of
the CUDA systems that matches your distribution, see `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__.

Instructions to run the code

Features
--------

Encoder models

    from encoders import prompting

    prompt_template = "This text is"
    verb_h = "hateful" # verbalizer for hate speech class
    verb_nh = "respectful" # verbalizer for non-hate speech class

    enc_p = prompting("deberta-base")

    enc_p.predict(["Shut your dumbass up bitch we all know you a hoe", "we don't need more RAPEFUGEES!"])

    >> ["hate", "not-hate"]
    
Instruction fine-tuned models

    from llms import prompting

    prompt_template = "Classify this text as hate or non-hate. Text:"
    output_indicator = "Answer:"

    llms_p = prompting("flant5")
  
    llms_p.predict(prompt_template, output_indicator, ["Shut your dumbass up bitch we all know you a hoe", "we don't need more RAPEFUGEES!"])

    >> ["hate", "not-hate"]

Input = dataframe || text || list of texts

Note: the instances used as examples are from a hate speech corpus. We did not create them.
